# GUN Media Distribution Implementation Progress

## 📋 Overview

This document tracks the real-time implementation progress of the GUN Media Storage and Distribution system based on the GPT-5 implementation plan. The system enables resilient, peer-assisted distribution of media assets using BitTorrent/WebTorrent as the primary data plane with GUN for metadata and discovery.

## 🎯 Implementation Status

**Started**: January 21, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Phase 3 - Production Features  
**Overall Progress**: 100% Phase 1 → 100% Phase 2 → 100% Phase 3 Complete

## 📊 Phase Progress

### Phase 1: Foundations ✅ COMPLETED
**Target**: Persistent seeding, basic upload/download, torrent creation
- [x] Create MediaSeeder service with WebTorrent integration
- [x] Add media routes to API (upload, download, manifest)
- [x] Extend GUN helper with media methods
- [x] Update media-manager for GUN backend
- [x] Mount media routes in main server
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite

### Phase 2: P2P Discovery & Replication ✅ COMPLETED
**Target**: GUN-based peer discovery and automatic replication
- [x] Peer registry in GUN (already implemented in Phase 1)
- [x] Media manifest storage in GUN (already implemented in Phase 1)
- [x] Automatic peer discovery and heartbeat system
- [x] Replication queue manager for cross-peer seeding
- [x] Peer coordination for media availability
- [x] Health monitoring and metrics collection
- [x] MediaCoordinator service orchestrating all components
- [x] Updated API routes with network awareness

### Phase 3: Production Features ✅ COMPLETED
**Target**: Encryption, monitoring, maintenance, performance
- [x] Per-asset encryption with key management
- [x] Advanced monitoring with Prometheus metrics
- [x] Maintenance procedures and cleanup systems
- [x] Performance optimization and caching
- [x] Access control and permission systems
- [x] Backup and recovery mechanisms
- [x] Enhanced MediaCoordinator with all Phase 3 services
- [x] Comprehensive production-ready API endpoints
