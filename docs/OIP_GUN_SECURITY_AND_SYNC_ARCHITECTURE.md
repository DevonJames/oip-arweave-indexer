# OIP GUN Security and Sync Architecture

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the security architecture for GUN record synchronization in the OIP (Open Index Protocol) system. It covers user authentication, encryption strategies, organization access control, and cross-node compatibility.

## üîê **Core Security Architecture**

### **Three-Tier Encryption System**

| Access Level | Encryption Type | Key Source | Who Can Decrypt | Cross-Node Sync |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Public** | None | N/A | Everyone | ‚úÖ Full sync |
| **Private** | Per-User | User's HD wallet + salt | Only the creator | ‚ùå Owner login required |
| **Organization** | Organization | Organization DID | All org members | ‚úÖ Full sync |

### **User Wallet System**

#### **HD Wallet Generation:**
```javascript
// Each user gets a unique HD wallet during registration
const mnemonic = bip39.generateMnemonic(); // 12-word recovery phrase
const seed = await bip39.mnemonicToSeed(mnemonic);
const userKey = masterKey.derivePath("m/44'/0'/0'/0/0");

// User gets:
// - Public key (stored in database)
// - Private key (encrypted with password)
// - Mnemonic (encrypted with password)
// - GUN encryption salt (encrypted with password)
```

#### **Cross-Node Compatibility:**
- **Mnemonic Export**: Users can view their 12-word recovery phrase
- **Wallet Import**: Users can import their wallet on any OIP node
- **Same Identity**: Same mnemonic = same wallet = same organization access

## üè¢ **Organization Access Control**

### **Organization Model (Corrected)**

**Roles:**
- **Admins Create**: Only organization admins can publish records with `access_level: "organization"`
- **Members Consume**: Organization members can read/access these records based on membership policy

**Membership Policies:**
- **Auto-Enroll App Users** (`membershipPolicy: 1`): Domain-based membership
- **Invite Only** (`membershipPolicy: 0`): Not yet implemented
- **Token-Gated** (`membershipPolicy: 2`): Not yet implemented  
- **Open Join** (`membershipPolicy: 3`): Not yet implemented

### **Domain-Based Membership (Auto-Enroll)**

For organizations with `membershipPolicy: 1`:

```javascript
// Organization: FitnessAlly (webUrl: "https://fitnessally.io")

‚úÖ GRANTED ACCESS:
- Requests from "https://fitnessally.io"
- Requests from "https://app.fitnessally.io" (subdomains)
- Organization admins (always, regardless of domain)

‚ùå DENIED ACCESS:
- Requests from "https://example.com" (different domain)
- Requests with no domain headers
```

### **Organization Encryption (Fixed)**

**Critical Security Fix Applied:**

‚ùå **BEFORE (Broken):**
```javascript
// Used registering user's public key
const orgEncryptionKey = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(
    orgPublicKey,  // Only registering user has private key for this!
    'oip-organization-encryption', 100000, 32, 'sha256'
);
```

‚úÖ **AFTER (Fixed):**
```javascript
// Use organization DID as deterministic key source
const orgEncryptionKey = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(
    organizationDid,  // Public info, all nodes can generate same key
    'oip-organization-encryption', 100000, 32, 'sha256'
);
```

**Why This Works:**
- Organization DID is public information
- All nodes can generate the same key deterministically
- No dependency on user private keys
- Perfect cross-node compatibility

## üîë **Per-User Encryption System**

### **User-Specific Encryption Keys**

Each user gets unique encryption capabilities:

```javascript
// 1. User registration generates unique salt
const gunEncryptionSalt = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');

// 2. Salt encrypted with user's password
const encryptedGunSalt = encryptSaltWithPassword(gunEncryptionSalt, password);

// 3. Encryption key derived from public key + salt
const encryptionKey = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(
    userPublicKey + ':' + gunSalt,
    'oip-gun-encryption', 100000, 32, 'sha256'
);
```

### **Security Benefits:**
- **True Privacy**: Only record creator can decrypt their private records
- **Cross-User Isolation**: Users cannot decrypt others' private records  
- **Password Protection**: Encryption salt protected by user's password
- **No Shared Secrets**: No hardcoded keys in source code

## üåê **Cross-Node Synchronization**

### **GUN Sync Service Architecture**

#### **Record Discovery:**
```javascript
// Registry-based discovery system
oip:registry ‚Üí {
  nodeId: "node-production-1",
  records: {
    "did:gun:soul1": { recordType: "exercise", creator: "pubkey1" },
    "did:gun:soul2": { recordType: "recipe", creator: "pubkey2" }
  }
}
```

#### **Sync Behavior by Encryption Type:**

**Public Records:**
```javascript
// Sync immediately - no decryption needed
await indexRecord(publicRecord);
```

**Organization Records:**
```javascript
// Decrypt with organization DID-based key
const orgKey = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(organizationDid, 'oip-organization-encryption', ...);
const decrypted = decrypt(encryptedRecord, orgKey);
await indexRecord(decrypted);
```

**Private Records:**
```javascript
// Queue for decryption when owner logs in
await decryptionQueue.queueForDecryption(encryptedRecord, ownerPublicKey);
```

### **Organization Owner Login Triggers Decryption**

When an organization owner logs into any node:

```javascript
// 1. User logs in with email + password
// 2. System generates same HD wallet (deterministic from credentials)
// 3. System decrypts user's private key
// 4. System finds organizations owned by this user
// 5. System processes decryption queue for those organizations
// 6. Organization records become available to members on this node
```

## üöÄ **User Experience Flows**

### **New User Registration:**
```javascript
1. User registers ‚Üí Gets mnemonic displayed immediately
2. User saves recovery phrase securely
3. User can publish private/organization records
4. User can import wallet on other nodes anytime
```

### **Cross-Node Migration:**
```javascript
1. User has account on Node A with organizations
2. User wants to use Node B
3. User goes to Node B ‚Üí "Import Wallet"
4. User enters email + password + 12-word mnemonic
5. Same wallet recreated ‚Üí organization records work immediately
```

### **Organization Member Access:**
```javascript
1. Admin publishes exercise for organization (encrypted)
2. Record syncs to all nodes (encrypted)
3. App user from correct domain requests exercises
4. System checks domain ‚Üí grants membership
5. System decrypts organization records
6. User gets workout data (seamlessly)
```
