## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Primary TTS engine
TTS_PRIMARY_ENGINE=kokoro

# Fallback engines (comma-separated)
TTS_FALLBACK_ENGINES=coqui,piper,espeak

# Model storage
MODEL_STORAGE_PATH=/app/models

# Caching
CACHE_ENABLED=true
CACHE_DIR=/app/cache

# Audio settings
DEFAULT_VOICE=en_female_01
SAMPLE_RATE=22050

```

### Engine Priority

1. **Kokoro TTS** - Highest quality, natural speech
2. **Coqui TTS** - High quality, open-source
3. **Piper TTS** - Fast synthesis, good quality
4. **eSpeak NG** - Reliable fallback, always available

## Installation

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Build the service
docker build -t kokoro-tts-service .

# Run the service
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e TTS_PRIMARY_ENGINE=kokoro \
  -e CACHE_ENABLED=true \
  -v ./models:/app/models \
  kokoro-tts-service
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the service
uvicorn kokoro_tts_service:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Synthesis

```python
import requests

response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/synthesize', json={
    'text': 'Hello, world!',
    'voice': 'en_female_01'
})

result = response.json()
print(f"Synthesized with {result['engine']} in {result['processing_time_ms']:.1f}ms")
```

### Engine-Specific Synthesis

```python
# Request specific engine
response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/synthesize', json={
    'text': 'This is a test of the Coqui TTS engine.',
    'engine': 'coqui',
    'voice': 'ljspeech'
})
```

### File Download

```python
response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/synthesize_to_file', json={
    'text': 'Download this as an audio file.',
    'voice': 'en_male_01'
})

with open('synthesis.wav', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Engine Comparison

| Engine | Quality | Speed | Memory | Use Case |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Kokoro** | Excellent | Medium | High | Production speech |
| **Coqui** | Very Good | Medium | Medium | High-quality backup |
| **Piper** | Good | Fast | Low | Real-time applications |
| **eSpeak** | Basic | Very Fast | Very Low | Fallback/accessibility |

### Expected Performance

- **Processing Time**: 200-800ms for typical sentences
- **Audio Quality**: 22kHz, 16-bit WAV output
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 80-90% for repeated content
- **Memory Usage**: 500MB-2GB depending on loaded engines

## Integration

### With Voice Pipeline

The Kokoro TTS service integrates seamlessly with the enhanced voice pipeline:

```javascript
// In routes/voice.js
const TTS_SERVICE_URL = process.env.TTS_SERVICE_URL || 'http://kokoro-tts:8000';

const ttsResponse = await axios.post(`${TTS_SERVICE_URL}/synthesize`, {
    text: processedText,
    voice: selectedVoice,
    engine: 'kokoro'
});
```

### Health Monitoring

```javascript
// Check service health
const health = await axios.get(`${TTS_SERVICE_URL}/health`);
console.log(`Available engines: ${health.data.available_engines.join(', ')}`);
```

## Development Notes

### Mock Implementation

The current implementation includes mock engines for development and testing:

- **Kokoro Engine**: Generates sine wave audio based on text characteristics
- **Actual Integration**: Ready for real Kokoro TTS model integration
- **Fallback Testing**: All engines can be tested independently

### Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Model Download**: Ensure Kokoro TTS models are available
2. **GPU Support**: Configure CUDA for accelerated synthesis
3. **Caching**: Enable Redis for distributed caching
4. **Monitoring**: Set up health check monitoring
5. **Load Balancing**: Deploy multiple instances for high availability

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Engine Not Loading**
   - Check model files are available
   - Verify dependencies are installed
   - Review logs for specific errors

2. **Poor Audio Quality**
   - Ensure correct sample rate settings
   - Check engine-specific configuration
   - Verify model integrity

3. **High Latency**
   - Enable caching for repeated requests
   - Consider using faster engines for real-time needs
   - Check system resources and GPU availability
