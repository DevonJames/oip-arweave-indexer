# Logging Cleanup Summary

## 📊 What Was Done

Reduced excessive verbose logging throughout the application and implemented clean API call logging with timestamps.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Created Clean API Logger** (`middleware/apiLogger.js`)

**New middleware that logs:**
- ✅ API calls with timestamp
- ✅ HTTP method and path
- ✅ Authentication status (authenticated/public)
- ✅ Query parameters (with long values truncated)
- ✅ Automatically skips health check spam (except main `/api/health`)

**Example output:**
```
[2025-10-17T06:30:15.123Z] GET /api/records (public) | query={"source":"gun","recordType":"userFitnessProfile","limit":"1"}
[2025-10-17T06:30:16.456Z] POST /api/records/newRecord (authenticated) | (body present)
[2025-10-17T06:30:17.789Z] GET /api/health/memory (public)
```

### 2. **Integrated API Logger** (`index.js`)

- Added `apiLogger` import
- Registered middleware early in the request pipeline
- Logs all API calls automatically

### 3. **Removed Verbose Logs from Routes** (`routes/records.js`)

**Removed:**
- `records.js enhanced with GUN support, records:` with full query dump
- Debug messages about empty records arrays
- `POST /api/records/newRecord` with full body
- `records.js recordTypes endpoint, summary:` messages

### 4. **Removed Authentication Noise** (`helpers/utils.js`)

**Removed:**
- `Optional authentication check... Token provided / No token`
- `No token provided - proceeding as unauthenticated user`
- `Token verified - proceeding as authenticated user: {email}`

### 5. **Silenced Elasticsearch Verbose Logs** (`helpers/elasticsearch.js`)

**Commented out 30+ verbose log statements:**

- ✅ `after filtering by source=...`
- ✅ `after filtering by storage=...`
- ✅ `after filtering by DID=...`
- ✅ `after filtering by equipment...`
- ✅ `after filtering by exercise type...`
- ✅ `after filtering by cuisine...`
- ✅ `after filtering by models...`
- ✅ `Filtering out non-public record for unauthenticated user:`
- ✅ `Filtering out legacy private conversation session...`
- ✅ `after filtering non-public records...`
- ✅ `Including owned record for user:`
- ✅ `Excluding private/shared record...`
- ✅ `after filtering records for authenticated user...`
- ✅ `all filters complete, there are X records`
- ✅ `sorting by:`
- ✅ `Applying noDuplicates filtering...`
- ✅ `Filtered X duplicate(s) for name...`
- ✅ All `🔍 DEBUG:` messages for pagination and sorting

**Note:** All logs are commented out (not deleted), so they can be easily re-enabled for debugging by uncommenting them.

## 📋 What You'll See Now

### ✅ Clean Logs You Will See:

```bash
[2025-10-17T06:30:15.123Z] GET /api/records (public) | query={"source":"gun","recordType":"userFitnessProfile","limit":"1"}
[2025-10-17T06:30:16.456Z] GET /api/records (authenticated) | query={"source":"gun","recordType":"workoutCompletion","resolveDepth":"0"}
[Memory Monitor] Heap: 2345MB / 16384MB (14.32%), RSS: 3456MB
[ALFRED Cache] Auto-cleared cache (156 entries) after 30 minutes
[GUN cache] Auto-cleared cache (789 records) after 60 minutes
```

### ❌ Verbose Logs You Won't See Anymore:

```bash
sorting by: inArweaveBlock:desc
🔍 DEBUG: Second pagination - resolvedRecords.length=1, startIndex=0, endIndex=1, paginatedRecords.length=1
records.js enhanced with GUN support, records: { ... huge object ... }
Optional authentication check... Token provided
Token verified - proceeding as authenticated user: admin@fitnessally.io
after filtering by source=gun, there are 780 records
after filtering by storage=gun, there are 780 records
Filtering out non-public record for unauthenticated user: did:gun:... access_level: private
after filtering non-public records for unauthenticated user, there are 0 records
all filters complete, there are 0 records
Applying noDuplicates filtering...
Filtered 5 duplicate(s) for name "..."
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Much Cleaner Logs** - Only essential information logged
2. **Better Performance** - Less I/O overhead from constant logging
3. **Easier Debugging** - Can actually see important logs (health checks, errors)
4. **Timestamps on API Calls** - Know exactly when requests came in
5. **Authentication Visibility** - See which endpoints are public vs authenticated
6. **Easy Re-enable** - All verbose logs are commented out, not deleted

## 🔧 Re-enabling Verbose Logs for Debugging

If you need verbose logging for debugging, simply uncomment the relevant logs in:

1. **`helpers/elasticsearch.js`** - Search for `// console.log` and uncomment as needed
2. **`helpers/utils.js`** - Uncomment auth logging if needed
3. **`routes/records.js`** - Uncomment route-specific logging if needed

Or set environment variable:
```bash
DEBUG_VERBOSE_LOGGING=true  # (feature not implemented yet, but could be added)
```

## 📁 Files Modified

1. ✅ **`middleware/apiLogger.js`** - NEW: Clean API logging middleware
2. ✅ **`index.js`** - Added apiLogger middleware
3. ✅ **`routes/records.js`** - Removed verbose logs
4. ✅ **`helpers/utils.js`** - Removed authentication noise
5. ✅ **`helpers/elasticsearch.js`** - Commented out 30+ verbose logs

## ✅ Test Your Logs

After restart, check logs:

```bash
# Watch clean logs
docker logs oip -f

# Or with grep for specific types
docker logs oip -f | grep "GET /api"
docker logs oip -f | grep "Memory Monitor"
docker logs oip -f | grep "Cache"
```

---

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Result:** Clean, readable logs with timestamps and essential information only

All verbose logging has been silenced while keeping health checks and important system messages visible.
