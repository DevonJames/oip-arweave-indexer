# Smart Turn Model Directory

This directory contains the Smart Turn v2 models for conversation endpoint detection.

Currently using enhanced mock implementation with:
- Audio feature analysis
- Transcript linguistic analysis  
- Temporal pattern detection
- Apple Silicon optimization

Expected models:
- smart-turn-v2.pt (PyTorch model)
- Configuration files
- Preprocessing utilities

The mock implementation provides realistic endpoint detection based on:
- Audio energy patterns
- Speech duration analysis
- Linguistic cues in transcripts
- Silence detection

Platform: Apple Silicon optimized
